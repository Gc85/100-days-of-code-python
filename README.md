# 100 Days of Code – Python Pro Bootcamp (Angela Yu)

## 📘 Overview

Welcome! This repository is my personal log and showcase for completing the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.

My goal is to develop solid Python programming skills and transition into a Python developer role — focusing initially on **web development** (Flask/Django) and potentially expanding into **data analysis**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Complete daily lessons and projects.
- ✅ Document my progress consistently.
- ✅ Apply Python in practical, real-world projects.
- ✅ Build a portfolio to support my career transition.
- ✅ Start applying for Python developer jobs in Japan within 3–6 months.
